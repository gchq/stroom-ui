 * This is a simple minimal input with no functionality, just styling.

 * The purpose is to provide what looks like edit-in-place, except it's
 * always an input and never anything else.
 *
 * It uses borders to achieve this:
 *  - No border and it just looks like test on the page
 *  - Hover shows a thin border and acts as an invitation to click
 *  - Focus shows a significant border and it looks like a normal input
